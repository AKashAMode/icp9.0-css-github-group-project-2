        Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often<br>
         brightly coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight.<br>
        The group comprises the superfamilies Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and Papilionoidea<br>
        (all others). The oldest butterfly fossils have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago,<br>
        though they likely originated in the Late Cretaceous, about 101 million years ago.<br>
        Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle, and like other holometabolous insects they undergo complete <br>
        <br>metamorphosis.[2] Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars,<br>
        will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. <br>
        When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, expands its wings to dry, and flies off.<br>

        Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation,<br>
         and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.<br>
         Butterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism to <br>
         evade their predators.[4] Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances.<br>
        Many butterflies are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other <br>
        invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they<br>
        can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies<br>
        (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants.<br>
        Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts. The Smithsonian Institution says<br>
        "butterflies are certainly one of the most appealing creatures in nature".
