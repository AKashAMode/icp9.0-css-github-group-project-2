            <b>Centipedes</b><br> 
            (from Neo-Latin centi-, "hundred", and Latin pes, pedis, "foot") are predatory arthropods<br>
             belonging to the class Chilopoda (Ancient Greek χεῖλος, kheilos, "lip", and Neo-Latin suffix<br>
            -poda, "foot", describing the forcipules) of the subphylum Myriapoda, an arthropod group<br>
            which includes millipedes and other multi-legged animals. Centipedes are elongated segmented<br>
            (metameric) creatures with one pair of legs per body segment. All centipedes are venomous<br>
            and can inflict painful stings, injecting their venom through pincer-like appendages known<br>
            as forcipules or toxicognaths, which are actually modified legs instead of fangs. Despite the<br>
            name, no centipede has exactly 100 legs; the number of pairs of legs is an odd number that<br>
            ranges from 15 pairs to 191 pairs.<br><br>   

            Centipedes are predominantly generalist carnivorous, hunting for a variety of prey items that <br>
            can be overpowered. They have a wide geographical range, which can be found in terrestrial habitats<br>
            from tropical rainforests to deserts. Within these habitats, centipedes require a moist microhabitat<br>
            because they lack the waxy cuticle of insects and arachnids, therefore causing them to rapidly lose water.<br>
             Accordingly, they avoid direct sunlight by staying under cover or by being active at night.<br><br>
             
             Description <br>
            Centipedes have a rounded or flattened head, bearing a pair of antennae at the forward margin.<br>
            They have a pair of elongated mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. The first pair of maxillae form<br>
            the lower lip, and bear short palps. The first pair of limbs stretch forward from the body over the mouth.<br>
            These limbs, or forcipules, end in sharp claws and include venom glands that help the animal to kill or<br>
            paralyze its prey.Their size ranges from a few millimetres in the smaller lithobiomorphs and geophilomorphs<br>
            to about 30 cm (12 in) in the largest scolopendromorphs.<br>
