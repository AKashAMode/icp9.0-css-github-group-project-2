        An earthworm is a soil-dwelling terrestrial invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Annelida.<br>
        The term is the common name for the largest members of the class<br> (or subclass, depending on the author) Oligochaeta.<br>
        In classical systems, they were in the order of Opisthopora since the male pores opened posterior<br>
        to the female pores, although the internal male segments are anterior to the female. <br>
        Theoretical cladistic studies have placed them in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida,<br>
        but this may change.[clarification needed] Other slang names<br>
         for earthworms include "dew-worm", "rainworm",
        "nightcrawler", and "angleworm" (from its use as angling hookbaits). Larger terrestrial earthworms are also<br>
        called megadriles (which translates to "big worms") as opposed to the microdriles ("small worms")<br>
        in the semiaquatic families Tubificidae, Lumbricidae<br> and Enchytraeidae. The megadriles are<br>
        characterized by a distinct clitellum (more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular<br>
        system with true capillaries.<br>

        Earthworms are commonly found in moist, compost-rich soil,<br> eating a wide variety of organic matters,<br>
        which include detritus, living protozoa, rotifers, nematodes,<br> bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms.<br>
        An earthworm's digestive system runs the length of its body.They are one of nature's most important<br>
        detritivores and coprophages, and also serve as food for many low-level consumers within the ecosystems.<br>

        Earthworms exhibit an externally segmented tube-within-a-tube<br> body plan with corresponding internal<br>
        segmentations, and usually have setae on all segments.<br> They have a cosmopolitan distribution<br>
        wherever soil, water and temperature conditions allow. They have a double transport system made<br>
        of coelomic fluid that moves within the fluid-filled coelom and a simple, closed circulatory system,<br>
        and respire (breathe) via cutaneous respiration. <br>> soft-bodied invertebrates, they lack a true skeleton,<br>
        but their structure is maintained by fluid-filled coelom<br> chambers that function as a hydrostatic skeleton<br>
