        Beetles are insects that form the order Coleoptera, in the superorder Holometabola.<br>
        Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing <br>
        them from most other insects. The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 described species, <br>
        is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal <br>
        new species are discovered frequently, with estimates suggesting that there are between 0.9 and 2.1<br>
         million total species. Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the polar regions, <br>
         they interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, <br>
         break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. Some species are serious agricultural pests,<br>
          such as the Colorado potato beetle, while others such as Coccinellidae eat aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other <br>
          plant-sucking insects that damage crops. Some others also have unusual characteristics, such as fireflies, which use a <br>
          light-emitting organ for mating and communication purposes.<br>

          Beetles typically have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though some such<br>
           as the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra.<br>
            The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are <br>
            several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under<br>
             the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are holometabolans, which means that they undergo<br>
              complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body<br>
               structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. Some,<br>
                such as stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged<br>
                 mandibles which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colors<br>
                  and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects.<br>
                   Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage.<br>
