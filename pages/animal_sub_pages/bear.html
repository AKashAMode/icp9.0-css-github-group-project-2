        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Polar bears are solitary animals, except for mothers with cubs and during mating season. They are excellent swimmers and are known to travel long distances in search of food. Their behavior is heavily influenced by the availability of sea ice, which they use as a platform for hunting seals.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>Polar bears are classified as vulnerable due to the effects of climate change, which is causing the loss of sea ice habitat. Conservation efforts focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting critical habitats, and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts.</p>
